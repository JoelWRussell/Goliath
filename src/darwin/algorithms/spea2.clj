(ns darwin.algorithms.spea2
  "An implementation of the SPEA2 algorithm of Zitzler et al. Well, almost. There's a very slight
  difference in way the archive is constructed. Using my technique you can replicate SPEA2 exactly, but
  it runs slowly. You can approximate the behaviour of SPEA2 and have it run pretty fast. I've tested
  the approximation on a few problems and it doesn't seem to make any real difference. See the archive
  thinner functions for details of the difference.

  This code is currently limited to two objectives, but the API is arranged so that should be easy to
  generalise if needed."

(defn thin-archive
  "SPEA2 has a fairly complicated prescription for thinning out the archive if it's oversized. It specifies
  that one should look for the individual who has the least distance to its nearest neighbour. If this doesn't
  yield a unique individual, then we should rank on distance to the second nearest neighbour, recursing until
  the tie is broken. We remove this individual from the population and repeat until we have thinned the archive
  to the desired size.

  We implement a modification of this algorithm. Instead we calculate for each point the distance to its
  `comparison-depth` nearest neighbours. We then sort the points lexicographically by these distance lists
  and drop the first item. Then we recalculate the distances and repeat to drop the desired number of items.
  If `comparison-depth` is the same as the archive size then this is equivalent to the SPEA2 technique,
  although spectacularly inefficient. Experiments have shown that using a `comparison-depth` of 5 does not
  give appreciably different results than SPEA2 for common problems."

;; * darwin.evolution.core configuration *

(defn spea2-config
  "A configuration implementing SPEA2. Needs to be fed the set of goal keys (which must be of
  length 2 currently) and the unary and binary genetic operations that will be used in reproduction.

  The SPEA2 algorithm preserves an elite population from generation to generation. On each iteration
  first the newly bred individuals will be pooled with the elite population, and all have their
  :spea2-fitness calculated. Then, a new elite population is constructed made up of the non-dominated
  individuals - with thinning if there are too many elite individuals, and promotion from the population
  if there are too few. Finally, a new generation is bred from the archived individuals, using binary
  tournament selection on the :spea2-fitness, and the cycle begins again.

  There are a couple of deviations from the SPEA2 algorithm as described in the literature. First, the
  thinning algorithm is slightly simplified (see above). The setting :comparison-depth controls this
  simplification. The default value should be fine. Second, there is the option to de-duplicate the elite
  and the population at every iteration. This is off by default, which I _think_ corresponds to the published
  algorithm, but can be controlled with the boolean :deduplicate option."
