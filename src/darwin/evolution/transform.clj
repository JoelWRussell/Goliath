  "Functions for transforming individuals, and the population. These can be supplied to the EA
  to perform non-EA transformations before scoring (see `darwin.evolution.core` for details.
  This namespace contains general helper functions for constructing transformations, and generic
  transformations that are representation independent. A given representation might implement more
  specific transformations (think simplifying symbolic regression expressions, for instance)."
